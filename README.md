# Pathfinding Visualization

This repository contains a visualization tool for various pathfinding algorithms implemented in Java.

## Overview

Pathfinding algorithms are essential in computer science for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. This project provides a visual representation of how different pathfinding algorithms work and their performance in various scenarios.

## Features

- Visualize the working of popular pathfinding algorithms such as:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Customize the grid size and obstacles to observe how algorithms adapt.
- Real-time visualization updates to track algorithm progress.
  
## Is Still On Progress?
- Yes. I want to add Dijkstra's Algorithm & A* Algorithm also.
